Iâ€™m a maker at heart, and I love building things that are both functional and beautifulâ€”whether that's through code, textiles, or other hobbies.

On my site, youâ€™ll find posts that follow my journey as a frontend engineer, including tutorials, tips, and insights into the technologies I use. I also share personal projects that reflect my interests outside of work, like sewing, knitting, and other creative endeavors.

I currently work on the Platform team at [Valon](https://valon.com/careers), where I build and maintain our design system, improve developer experience, and help scale our frontend architecture.

When Iâ€™m not busy writing code, youâ€™ll find me exploring the greater Bay Area, spending quality time with my five cats, or working on a knitting or sewing project.
