It's been a minute since I last updated my site. I ran into an issue a couple years ago where things just...stopped working. I tried pulling a fresh clone of my site and running `npm install` and I'd get nothing but errors. Over the the past three years, I've made a couple of attempts to fix the situation including:

1. an attempt to [unsuccessfully] update the packages in the previous iteration to get things working
1. moving to Next.js and integrating TinaCMS to have a more visual editing experience
1. creating a new "v2" version of my Gatsby site

I ultimately went with creating the "v2" version of my Gatsby site.

One of the things I really liked about my Gatsby site was the editing experience. I like writing posts in markdown; it's less fussy and obtrusive, and it helps me keep focused on writing, rather than looking at tweaks I could be making to my site.
